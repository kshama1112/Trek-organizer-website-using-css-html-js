            <h3>CHANNARAYANA DURGA TREK</h3>
            <p class="para">Channarayana Durga Trek is located near to Madhugiri in the Tumkur district of Karnataka. A trek that is very close to our hearts at Indiahikes since it reveals many surprises as you go climbing through each of its layers of the fort. <br> <br>

                The trek is very much accessible and close to the SH 9 state highway connecting Madhugiri and Dabaspet. The beautiful majestic fort reminds you of medieval times that was used as a strategic fortress in this region of Madhugiri and Tumkur. It is one of the Navadurgas around Bangalore, the entire fort is divided into multiple layers and sections. <br><br>
                
                One can clearly see the brilliant minds that went into the design and structure of this fort that was built during the 16th century. The fort is daunting to you right from the time you are starting the trek from the base and it gets grandiose as you come closer. <br><br>
                
                Just the sheer climb through the granite rocks adds to the thrill. Be it with false doors leading you to the wrong side of the fort, a reservoir to store water throughout the year and ancient hallways mark this for an exploration one must truly venture into. <br><br>
                
                The view from the top of the fort is also a sight to witness. You get to see the famous monolith of Madhugiri from the top and other surrounding hillocks in a grand setting. <br><br>
                
                The trek is ideal for any age group and especially for families, friends, and colleagues to start trekking. A fit trekker can complete the trek within a couple of hours while those who want to take it leisurely can spend half a day easily exploring the trek.
