            <h3>A Legendary Trail the World Wants to Trek in</h3>
            <p class="para">The Valley of Flowers trek is one of India’s most popular treks in the Himalayas. People who haven’t even stepped into the Himalayas, have heard about the Valley of Flowers trek. <br>

                But there is a solid reason behind Valley Of Flower’s legendary popularity – it is one of India’s oldest known treks. <br>
                
                In 1980, the Indian government created the Valley of Flowers National Park, and later in 2002, it was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This pushed Valley of Flowers on the bucket list of trekkers from around the world. <br>
                
                Having said that, you must note that the Valley Of Flowers trek is not easy. It is a moderate level trek, with slightly longer trekking days and a steep ascent to Hemkund Sahib that will challenge your endurance. So, prepare well for this trek. We have talked in detail about this in the ‘difficulty’ section of this trek guide. <br>
                
                This extensive trek guide contains all details you need to know to do this trek. <br>
                
                And, it also contains an interesting insight, a story of how one can fall in love with Himalayan treks after trekking to the Valley of Flowers and Hemkund Sahib. Yes, that can happen. We know because it happened with Sandhya UC, Co-Founder and COO of Indiahikes. <br>
