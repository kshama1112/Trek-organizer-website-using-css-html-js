            <h3>Jammu and Kashmir's new trek discovery</h3>
            <p class="para">While some of our treks in Jammu & Kashmir are very popular, only a few know that other treks in Jammu & Kashmir are equally exciting, yet the adventure is different.<br>

                The new Brammah Valley trek in the Kishtwar National Park blends the beauty of Kashmir with the kind of landscape we have not usually seen on treks.  <br>
                
                First, the Brammah Valley trek offers stunning views of the four prominent peaks of Kishtwar, all above 6,000 m. Getting so close to such big summits on a trek is rare. It’s not just the summit; you see these big mountains from the base to the summit! To compare, at Gaumukh Tapovan, trekkers see the full height of Mt. Shivling and are in complete awe. They get to see around 2,500 metres of the mountain. On the Brammah Valley trek, you see almost 4,000 metres of the big mountains in one go! The impact is nearly two times as much. <br>
                
                You also camp next to these mountains at Kiddar Maidan, the trek's unique river delta campsite. <br>
                
                From the Kiddar Maidan campsite, on your left are the Eiger and Tarparan summits. On your right lies Mt. Brammah I, the second-highest peak in Jammu. Right next to it is the prominent Mt. Brammah Wife (surprisingly, that is the name!)
                
                On this trek, you are trekking through the heart of the Kishtwar National Park. Kishtwar is known for its dense forest. You trek through the forests every day of your trek. The gradient of these forests is gently ascending with short steep sections, making it a very pleasant trek. <br>
                
                These are primarily coniferous, with a heady scent wafting through the woods as you trek along. In between are maples, except for a small patch of beautiful silver birch trees just before Kiddar Maidan. The variety of coniferous trees you find on this trek is unmatched. There are Chir pines, Deodars, Abies pin-drow, and spruces. The trees are sometimes so tall that they almost touch the sky. <br>
                
                What trekkers will love about these forests is how they are laid out. Every moment in the forest is mesmerising. Now and then, lovely clearings pop out of the forests. At other times, sunlight streams in through the trees in wonderful layers. <br>
                
                At every turn, there are exciting views. It becomes like a game to see what new surprises the forests have in store for us. <br>
                
                The Nath river accompanies you throughout the trek. Even while trekking in the deep forests, you constantly hear the river. The river starts to calm down as you trek deeper into the valley and becomes completely silent when you reach Kiddar Maidan. In the extensive grasslands of Kiddar Maidan, beside the silently gliding Nath river, is where we camp. If there were awards for the most beautiful campsites on our treks — this would be one of the top contenders. <br>
                
                Kishtwar is surrounded by high mountains, making it a natural fortress. The steep mountains provide a natural barrier to the outside world. This may be why Kistwar has always been so isolated from the rest of the country. <br>
                
                The Kistwar valley is also known for its alpine meadows and high-altitude wetlands. Our Brammah Valley trek takes us through each of these wonders. <br>
                
                Kishtwaris comprise most of the valley's population and are well-known for their distinctive culture, practises, and language. Unlike the rest of Kashmir, we see temples and mosques coexisting. A part of our trek falls on the trek to the Hudh Mata temple. <br>
                
                Even the architecture of the houses is distinctive. On the trek, we pass through tiny villages hanging on hillsides. Yet, from their precarious perches, the homes display an architecture from a world we rarely see. <br>
                
                In the Brammah valley, trekkers will find a new world of discovery waiting to be made. Trekkers must take advantage of the few spots we have available on the trek this year.
