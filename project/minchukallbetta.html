            <h3>Minchukallu Betta</h3>
            <p class="para">Minchukallu betta is a massive hill, located around 85 km from Bangalore. Not so popular among trekkers, this was once a three-stage fortified hill. The ruins of the fort wall and temple are some wonders to think about when you are trekking here.<br><br>

                The trek starts from Masanipalya village, 18 km away from Tumkur. You can also approach the hilllock from Hoskote of Tumkur region. The hill looks like a perfectly carved hemisphere from Hoskote. From Masanipalya village, the stepped multilayered hillock is a great sight for the start of your adventure.<br><br>
                
                Minchukallu trek, also called Minchukallu by locals, takes you through many different trails. For a short trek, the surprises that it takes you through in the first 1 km is unpredictable. During monsoon, you’ll get to see many pretty streams along the way. You’ll even have to walk in the water canal to reach the base!<br><br>
                
                Once on top, it opens to the magnificent views of all the hills around. You get to see Jenukallu gudda, Hoskote Timappa betta, Devarayana Durga hills and even an aerial view of Hoskote lake and its surroundings. There is a Hanuman Temple on the top and villagers trek there on occasions to worship. During other times, mostly the hill is deserted.<br><br>
                
                The trek is ideal for any age group and especially for families, friends, and colleagues to start trekking. A fit trekker can complete the trek within a couple of hours while those who want to take it leisurely can spend half a day easily exploring the trek.
